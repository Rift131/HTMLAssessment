# HTML Assessment

# Description
This assignment is  a simple run-through of common HTML elements and attributes used to build a web-page.

# Technologies Used
HTML

# What I Learned
The Code Academy coursed were a great resource for learning the basics of creating forms and tables. Writing the HTML syntax lead to a greater understanding of wrapping elements within elements. The use of attributes greatly revealed how the HTML documentation lends itself to any code that will be written in Java ("values" and "submit" for example).

Finally. DO NOT use githubs built-in README generator.
